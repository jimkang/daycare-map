      This is a map of daycare providers available in the state of Massachusetts. You can drag to pan the map around and you can use the + and - buttons to zoom in and out. If you see a daycare provider at a location you are interested in, you can click or tap the marker to get more information about it. <a class="relaxed-link" id="dismiss-explanation-link">[Hide this]</a>

      This map app was built with data from the <a href="http://www.eec.state.ma.us/ChildCareSearch/searchEarlyEdu.aspx">Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care</a>. It tries to include all of the data from that site, but because of issues with locating some of the addresses on a map, not all of the providers are included here. <a href="http://www.eec.state.ma.us/ChildCareSearch/searchEarlyEdu.aspx">Try searching there</a> as well if you are not satisfied with what you find here.
